# WP System Log < 1.0.21 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
Description
<br>
The plugin does not sanitise, validate and escape the IP address retrieved from login requests before outputting them in the admin dashboard, which could allow unauthenticated attacker to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against admins viewing the logs.
<br>
# Proof of Concept
```
POST /wp-login.php HTTP/1.1
