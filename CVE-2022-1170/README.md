# JobMonster < 4.5.2.9 - Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
Description

In the theme JobMonster there is a XSS vulnerability as the input for the search form is provided through unsanitized GET requests.



Note (WPScanTeam): It's unclear which exact version fixed the issue, but the lowest we were able to test and confirm remediation was 4.5.2.9.
