# Tickera < 3.4.8.3 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
Description

The plugin does not properly sanitise and escape the Name fields of booked Events before outputting them in the Orders admin dashboard, which could allow unauthenticated users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against admins.

# Proof of Concept
```
As unauthenticated, book an Event, and put the following payload in the Buyer Info First or Last Name: <svg/onload=alert(/XSS/)>



The XSS will be triggered when admin view the Orders page in the admin dashboard (/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=tc_orders)
