# Newsmag < 5.0 - Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
Description
<br>
The theme does not sanitise the td_block_id parameter in its td_ajax_block  AJAX action, leading to an unauthenticated Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
<br>
Due to a nonce check, this issue is only exploitable on unauthenticated users (for as long as the nonce used in the request is valid)
<br>
